## Introduction
This project is a student scheduler. Students will use this website to schedule meetings, remember deadlines and plan their time effectively. 
System Overview
This system would have a calendar where students can click on specific dates and schedule meetings, reminders and deadlines on it. It will have a login/Sign up feature because students need to have specific accounts to work.

## Class Diagram Description
Firstly, we have the main class, which would be the user class. The user class contains basic information about the user that is necessary such as userId, name and their email. The class also contains methods to schedule and join events along with getting their calendar information. We then have a UserEvent class which acts as a bridge between the user and event classes. This is to keep the user and event independent of one another so we use the user event class as a middle man. The event classâ€™s only purpose is to store information regarding the event. Last but not least we have the calendar class, which is responsible for all things event. This is the class which is responsible for creating, deleting and changing events.

I emailed the teacher and He let me use Jira instead of Scrumy, but the link cannot be shared publicly so I attached an image.
